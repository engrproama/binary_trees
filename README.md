# WHAT IS A BINARY TRE
- A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node can have at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root, and the bottom-most nodes are called leaves. A binary tree can be visualized as a hierarchical structure with the root at the top and the leaves at the bottom.

- Binary trees have many applications in computer science, including data storage and retrieval, expression evaluation, network routing, and game AI. They can also be used to implement various algorithms such as searching, sorting, and graph algorithms.

A tree is a popular data structure that is non-linear in nature. Unlike other data structures like an array, stack, queue, and linked list which are linear in nature, a tree represents a hierarchical structure. The ordering information of a tree is not important. A tree contains nodes and 2 pointers. These two pointers are the left child and the right child of the parent node. Let us understand the terms of tree in detail.

- Root: The root of a tree is the topmost node of the tree that has no parent node. There is only one root node in every tree.
- Parent Node:  The node which is a predecessor of a node is called the parent node of that node.
- Child Node: The node which is the immediate successor of a node is called the child node of that node.
- Sibling: Children of the same parent node are called siblings.
- Edge: Edge acts as a link between the parent node and the child node.
- Leaf: A node that has no child is known as the leaf node. It is the last node of the tree. There can be multiple leaf nodes in a tree.
- Subtree: The subtree of a node is the tree considering that particular node as the root node.
- Depth: The depth of the node is the distance from the root node to that particular node.
- Height: The height of the node is the distance from that node to the deepest node of that subtree.
- Height of tree: The Height of the tree is the maximum height of any node. This is the same as the height of the root node.
- Level: A level is the number of parent nodes corresponding to a given node of the tree.
- Degree of node:  The degree of a node is the number of its children.
- NULL: The number of NULL nodes in a binary tree is (N+1), where N is the number of nodes in a binary tree.
# The main applications of tree data structure: 
- Manipulate hierarchical data. 
- Make information easy to search (see tree traversal). 
- Manipulate sorted lists of data. 
- As a workflow for compositing digital images for visual effects. 
- Router algorithms 
- Form of multi-stage decision-making (see business chess). 
- Trees can be used to represent the structure of a sentence, and can be used in parsing algorithms to analyze the grammar of a sentence.
- Trees can be used to represent the decision-making process of computer-controlled characters in games, such as in decision trees.
- Huffman coding uses a tree to represent the frequency of characters in a text, which can be used for data compression.
- Trees are used to represent the syntax of a programming language, and can be used in compiler design to check the syntax of a program and generate machine code.
